school project

i tried to upload a video to this project originally, but kept getting errors i couldn't fix,
that's why there are some files here that aren't used in the final version.
i wanted to include them anyway for the sake of showing my work, also so that it could be seen that i tried.
i wanted to add an fft sound visualisation as well, but kept getting the same CORS error, so i had to give up eventually.
i didn't have enough time to fix all this unfortunately.
my slider starts at 0.001 instead of 0 to avoid problems with one of the seriously.js effects.
the seriously.js effects aren't mine, they're taken from a public library.
